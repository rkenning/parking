#===== Preparing our data =====

# Load the BANEScarparking package (for the data!)
# Install or update first if necessary (make sure you're on v0.1.3):
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("owenjonesuob/BANEScarparking")
library(BANEScarparking)

# Load packages for manipulating data

# * "events" data frame is also from BANEScarparking! But have a look at the
#   documentation for get_events() and get_rugby() in the package, if you want
#   to update with more recent records. They scrape the relevant websites to
#   get the data. The code for those functions is really well commented so if
#   you want to do some web scraping yourself have a look at the code by
#   following the link to GitHub in the documentation.
