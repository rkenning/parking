# BMLM: Parking prediction project

### Learn data science and machine learning by working on a project!

We are using the [BANES Historic Car Park Occupancy](https://data.bathhacked.org/Government-and-Society/BANES-Historic-Car-Park-Occupancy/x29s-cczc) dataset along with various machine learning techniques to try to predict the future occupancy of Bath's eight car parks.

The project has been running since 9th November 2016, and we hold regular "Project Time" [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Bath-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) where we share what we've been working on and try things out together.

The primary purpose of the project is to "learn machine learning by doing machine learning". As the project has developed, we've been able to start visualising and presenting the data, information and techniques we're working with, so that people outside the project can see what we've been up to!

Ultimately, our goal is to create and launch an app which visitors, residents and local business owners can use to help them see how busy Bath is likely to be at a given time in the future.

Please feel free to [join our Slack server](http://bathml.herokuapp.com/) to keep up to date with the project as it develops, to ask questions about the project or programming/ML/data science in general, or just to introduce yourself!

No knowledge of machine learning, Git(Hub) or programming languages is required to contribute - we ask only that you have a desire to learn.
